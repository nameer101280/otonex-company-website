WHY DEVTROX?

## The creative partner that actually gets your business

### We think like your customers,   not just designers

Every pixel serves a purpose. We start with your business goals, understand your audience deeply, then craft experiences that guide them exactly where you want them to go.

### From brief to launch in weeks,   not months

While other agencies keep you waiting for months, we deliver exceptional results fast. Our streamlined process means you're live and generating leads while your competitors are still in their first revision.

### We build websites and brands    that grow with your business

Whether you're handling 100 or 100,000 visitors, your website and brand assets scale seamlessly with your success. No redesigns needed every few months.

### We design for conversions,   not just compliments

We obsess over the metrics that matter to your business - conversion rates, lead generation, and customer retention. Every design decision is backed by data and proven to drive results.

FAQs

## Have Questions?  We Have the Answers

How long does a typical project take?

Website/Landing pages: 2-3 weeks. Logo design: 5-7 days. Full branding: 3-4 weeks. We work fast without compromising quality because we know speed matters for startups.

What if I don't like the initial design?

We offer unlimited revisions until you're 100% satisfied. Our process starts with deep research into your brand and audience, so we typically nail it early. But if not, we keep refining until it's perfect.

Do you work with early-stage startups?

Absolutely. We've helped 80+ startups go from idea to funded. We understand tight budgets and urgent timelines – that's why we created packages specifically for different growth stages.

What's included in 'unlimited revisions'?

Any changes to design, layout, colors, typography, or content within the agreed scope. We don't nickel-and-dime you for tweaks – we want you to love the final result.

Can you help with ongoing design needs?

Yes! Many clients start with a website or logo, then move to our monthly design packages for ongoing marketing materials, social media, and product design support.

Do you provide the source files?

Every project includes all source files (Figma, AI, PSD), exported assets, and a style guide. You own everything we create – no strings attached.

What makes you different from other design agencies?

We specialize in startups and understand the unique challenges of building a brand from scratch. We're not just designers – we're growth partners who know what converts.

Do you offer payment plans?

Yes, we offer flexible payment options for all packages. Typically 50% upfront, 50% on completion. We want to make professional design accessible to ambitious founders.
